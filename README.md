# pfoti - page front of the internet

The goal of this project is to have a better understanding of Vue, Vuetify, and Nuxt.js with hands on learning. Without using a database to store personal data, this project will allow the user to have personal notes, view the local weather and events, and have music recommendations given to them daily. Privacy is important, and I never plan on making money from this app, so why would I want your info?
